Real Time NodeJS / MongoDb Chat
=======================

This is just a chat application that I made in order to learn a little bit of NodeJS.

It is basically a chat application that shows the last 10 messages when an users connects.

It also stores all the messages in the a mongoDb database.

What I've used
=======================

* Twitter Bootstrap in the front end
* Jquery to insert messages in the client-side.
* NodeJS / Socket.io / Express to make real time updates
* MongoDb to store the messages

Any feedback, question, contribution will be appreciated.
